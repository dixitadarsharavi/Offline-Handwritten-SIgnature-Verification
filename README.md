# Offline-Handwritten-SIgnature-Verification
Here I have implemented an algorithm to compare 2 images A and B and verify if the signature B is same as signature A. 
The approach started with using appropriate processing techniques such as cropping, converting the image to greyscale, thresholding followed by applying Sobel filters and finally with the retrieved vector values the 2 images were compared and verified.
Entire application was written and executed using processing tool.
